                        Why is this at the end, you may ask? Because I believe my projects speak
                        for themselves, showcasing my skills and passion as an engineer. I'm a Full

                        My focus lies in solving real-world problems through clean, scalable, and

                        My interest in computers reached its zenith when I was twelve years old. I commenced learning to
                        code when I was sixteen, and my first programming language was Python.
                        Although I did learn Python, lifeâ€™s ups and downs compelled me to abandon it due to academic
                        reasons, as is the case in India. However, my passion for programming endured, and I am
                        currently engaged in creating websites for both recreational and professional purposes.
